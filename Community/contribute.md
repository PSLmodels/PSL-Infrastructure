# Contributing to PSL

You are welcome to contribute to PSL by making a technical contribution to PSL infrastructure like the website and Catalog-Builder, adding a model to the library, or contributing to one of the models already in the library.

When you feel that you have made a valuable contribution, please add it to RELEASES.md. If you think PSL users should know about it, add it to NEWS.md. If your name is not already in contributors.md, add it.

To nominate a model for the library, contact librarian Matt Jensen (matt.h.jensen@gmail.com). 

while each model in the library will have its own set of instructions for contributing.
You can view each model in the [catalog](catalog.html) for
specific instructions on contributing.
