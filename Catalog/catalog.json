This dataframe is cached in a pickle file to be used in later runs, thereby reducing run time.</li> </ul> </li> <li><code>./run_examples/baseline_byasset.csv</code><ul> <li>Cost of capital, marginal effective tax rates, effective average tax rates, and other model output for the baseline policy, organized by asset.</li> </ul> </li> <li><code>./run_examples/baseline_byindustry.csv</code><ul> <li>Cost of capital, marginal effective tax rates, effective average tax rates, and other model output for the baseline policy, organized by production industry.</li> </ul> </li> <li><code>./run_examples/reform_byasset.csv</code><ul> <li>Cost of capital, marginal effective tax rates, effective average tax rates, and other model output for the reform policy, organized by asset.</li> </ul> </li> <li><code>./run_examples/reform_byindustry.csv</code><ul> <li>Cost of capital, marginal effective tax rates, effective average tax rates, and other model output for the refrom policy, organized by production industry.</li> </ul> </li> <li><code>./run_examples/changed_byasset.csv</code><ul> <li>Differences in cost of capital, marginal effective tax rates, effective average tax rates, and other model output between the baseline and reform reform policies, organized by asset.</li> </ul> </li> <li><code>./run_examples/changed_byindustry.csv</code><ul> <li>Differences in cost of capital, marginal effective tax rates, effective average tax rates, and other model output between the baseline and reform reform policies, organized by production industry.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> </li> </ul> <p>The CSV output files can be compared to the <code>./run_examples/*_expected.csv</code> files that are checked into the repository to confirm that you are generating the expected output.  If you run into errors running the example script, please open a new issue in the B-Tax repo with a description of the issue and any relevant tracebacks you receive.</p> <p>The <strong>second way</strong> to use B-Tax is through a web application, <a href=\"http://www.ospc.org/ccc\">Cost of Capital Calculator</a>.  This way allows you to generate estimates of marginal effective tax rates and the cost of capital across production industries, type of asset, and separately for corporate and non-corporate entites and different forms of financing.  The web application is limited in that you cannot consider policy reforms to the individual income tax code.</p> <p>Of course, you can get started with B-Tax both ways.</p>"

THE CODE SHOULD NOT CURRENTLY BE USED FOR PUBLICATIONS, JOURNAL ARTICLES, OR RESEARCH PURPOSES. Essentially, you should assume the calculations are unreliable until we finish the code re-architecture and have checked the results against other existing implementations of the tax code. The package will have released versions, which will be checked against existing code prior to release. Stay tuned for an upcoming release!</p>"
